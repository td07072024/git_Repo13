India stands not as a mere spectator but as a prominent player in the global solar revolution. India currently stands 4th globally in solar power capacity. In the last five years, the countryâ€™s solar installed capacity has experienced a monumental transformation, increasing from 21,651 MW to 70,096 MW in 2023. With ambitious targets and policies like the Production Linked Incentive (PLI), India is propelling itself to achieve 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030. The commitment is not just towards sustainable energy but towards securing a greener tomorrow for the entire planet.
